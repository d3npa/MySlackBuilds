i made a little repo for software i want to use on my slackware devices
this repo is a bit unclean..sorry for that!

you can use these slackbuilds manually or use them with sbopkg

```
# /etc/sbopkg/repos.d/70-slackhax.repo
slackhax 15.0 "slackhax Repo" _k rsync pixeldreams.tokyo::pub/slackbuilds/15.0 ""
```
